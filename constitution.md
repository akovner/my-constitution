Constitution
============

*This constitution is written as a general template for the constitution of a centralized state; i.e. one in which administrative subdivisions (if any) exist at the discretion of the national government, and can be superseded by the national government in all matters.*

*This text contains numerous explanatory notes which appear in italics. They would not be binding in an official constitution.*

Entities
--------

*There are three broad types of entities with which a constitution must deal: persons, associations, and administrative subdivisions. This constitution does not deal with administrative subdivisions, because in a centralized state, they fall entirely within the regime of ordinary statute.*

### Person

A person is a living human being subsequent to birth. *Constitutionally, an embryo prior to birth is not a person. This is simply a jurisdictional matter: prior to birth, the embryo is under the sovereign control of its host. This does not necessarily prevent the outlaw of abortion, it does, however, prevent using protection of the embryo's personhood as a justification for doing so.*

#### Citizen

A citizen is any person who is

1. born within the territory of the country, or
1. born to a parent who is a citizen, or parents who are citizens, according to criteria and procedures to be set forth in law, or
1. naturalized according to criteria and procedures to be set forth in law.

Citizenship cannot be removed from any citizen without their consent. No coercion may be applied to induce a citizen to relinquish their citizenship, nor may any reward be offered for the same.

##### Callable Citizen

The determination of medical incapacity must be made separately for each act of political participation, by different qualified medical professionals in each case.
