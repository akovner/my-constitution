Constitution
============

*This constitution is written as a general template for the constitution of a centralized state; i.e. one in which administrative subdivisions (if any) exist at the discretion of the national government, and can be superseded by the national government in all matters.*

*This text contains numerous explanatory notes which appear in italics. They would not be binding in an official constitution.*

These are distinct from ordinary laws in being harder to change (requiring higher thresholds) but also not including budgets or implementation details.

  <tr><td>The judiciary acts through judicial orders, not through precedent. All opinions written by the court, and all precedent following from those opinions, is for communication purposes only, and does not have the force of law. Only a judicial order issued according to legislation specifically creating such an order, and bounding its scope, shall be enforceable. No judicial order may exceed the scope of the case it addresses, which is a dispute between two parties.</td><td>Politically appointed executive branch officials make policy within the scope of the offices they hold, consistent with the executive branch hierarchy. Each political officer has an independent duty to implement all legal policies and refuse to implement all illegal policies.</td></tr>
