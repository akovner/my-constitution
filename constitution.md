Constitution
============

*This constitution is written as a general template for the constitution of a centralized state; i.e. one in which administrative subdivisions (if any) exist at the discretion of the national government, and can be superseded by the national government in all matters.*

*This text contains numerous explanatory notes which appear in italics. They would not be binding in an official constitution.*

All opinions written by the court, and all precedent following from those opinions, is for communication purposes only, and does not have the force of law. Only a judicial order issued according to legislation specifically creating such an order, and bounding its scope, shall be enforceable. No judicial order may exceed the scope of the case it addresses, which is a dispute between two parties.</td><td>Politically appointed executive branch officials make policy within the scope of the offices they hold, consistent with the executive branch hierarchy. Each political officer has an independent duty to implement all legal policies and refuse to implement all illegal policies.</td></tr>

## Legislature (Proposing and Deciding)

The most important procedure for making political decisions is the proposing/deciding process, in which a permanent assembly made up of appointed representatives makes proposals according to the superminority principle. Those proposals are then considered by a citizen jury (deciding assembly), which makes the final decision by secret ballot.

### Proposing Assemblies (parliament)

The proposing assembly shall consists of 400 members serving 4 year terms each. The proposing assembly shall meet in 4 separate sessions each year, making the total term for a representative 16 sessions. The terms of representatives shall be staggered such that 25 members have terms that expire after each session. New members shall be appointed by the political parties according to the system of rolling elections.

#### The legislative agenda

The agenda shall be a binding list of topics for which parliament shall generate proposals that will be submitted to a citizen jury. Each agenda item shall have the following specifics:

1. A description of the topic or issue to be legislated upon
2. The superminority threshold under which proposals are to be generated. Must be a threshold to generate between 3 and 7 proposals.
3. The date by which proposals are due
4. The length of time for jury deliberation (between 3 and 6 weeks)
5. The size of the jury, between 500 and 2000
6. The size of small groups within the jury, between 5 and 15
