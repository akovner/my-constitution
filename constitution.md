Constitution
============

*This constitution is written as a general template for the constitution of a centralized state; i.e. one in which administrative subdivisions (if any) exist at the discretion of the national government, and can be superseded by the national government in all matters.*

*This text contains numerous explanatory notes which appear in italics. They would not be binding in an official constitution.*

Entities
--------

*There are three broad types of entities with which a constitution must deal: persons, associations, and administrative subdivisions. This constitution does not deal with administrative subdivisions, because in a centralized state, they fall entirely within the regime of ordinary statute.*

### Person

A person is a living human being subsequent to birth. *Constitutionally, an embryo prior to birth is not a person. This is simply a jurisdictional matter: prior to birth, the embryo is under the sovereign control of its host. This does not necessarily prevent the outlaw of abortion, it does, however, prevent using protection of the embryo's personhood as a justification for doing so.*

#### Citizen

A citizen is any person who is

1. born within the territory of the country, or
1. born to a parent who is a citizen, or parents who are citizens, according to criteria and procedures to be set forth in law, or
1. naturalized according to criteria and procedures to be set forth in law.

Citizenship cannot be removed from any citizen without their consent. No coercion may be applied to induce a citizen to relinquish their citizenship, nor may any reward be offered for the same.

##### Callable Citizen

A callable citizen is a citizen who has reach 16 years of age. Callable citizens have both an inalienable right and a legally enforceable obligation to participate in mandatory acts of political participation, including but not limited to all elections and citizen juries for which they are selected. This right and obligation cannot be removed for any reason. Only persons who are deemed medically incapable meeting the obligations of participation may be excused. The determination of medical incapacity must be made separately for each act of political participation, by different qualified medical professionals in each case.

#### Resident

A resident is any person who spends the plurality of their time over any 365 day period within the sovereign territory of the country, and is subject to the laws of the country. This designation shall apply only during such a 365 day period. *Diplomats should be excluded from residency by this definition.*

##### Legal Resident

A legal resident is a resident who is legally authorized to reside in the country. *This definition includes citizens who live in the country.*

##### Illegal Resident

A resident who is not a legal resident.

#### Guest

A guest is any person who is present in the sovereign territory of the country, but does not meet the criteria for a resident.

##### Sovereign Guest

A sovereign guest is a guest whose presence in the country is authorized under law but who is not subject to the laws of the country. *Used primarily for diplomats.*

##### Ordinary Guest

An ordinary guest is a guest whose presence in the country is authorized under law and is subject to the laws of the country.

##### Illegal Guest

An illegal guest is a guest whose presence in the country is not authorized under law. All illegal guests are subject to the laws of the country.

#### Foreigner

Any person who does not conform to any of the previous categories of persons. Foreigners are not subject to the laws of the country.

### Association

An association is any group of two or more persons who knowingly act together for a common purpose, or for mutually reinforcing purposes. Those who act together are said to be members of the association.

**Purpose** The common purpose or mutually reinforcing purposes of an association will herein be simply called the association's **purpose**.

#### Private Association

A private association is an association whose effects on non-members is only incidental, and is similar in scope and magnitude to the effects that non-members might experience were the members of the association acting separately. *This is a pretty narrow definition, involving people meeting for coffee or building go-karts in their backyards.*

#### Protected Association

A protected association is an association whose effects on non-members is either incidental, or the result of constitutionally protected activities. Constitutionally protected activities must provide a test or tests for determining when a given protected activity infringes on the protections afforded to others. *Religious organizations, publications of news and commentary, etc. are not private organizations because they have significant effects on others. Nevertheless, we protect these activities based on a belief that some negative consequences of such activities to others must be born without legal relief for the good of society as a whole. The conditions under which activities are protected, and the extent of the protection, should be sketched out in the constitution, and further refined under statute and through the judiciary.*

#### Illegal Association

An illegal association is an association whose purpose is fundamentally contrary to law. *Terrorist groups, drug cartels, human trafficking rings, etc. An association that commits a crime is not necessarily an illegal association.*

#### Commercial Association, aka firm, company, corporation

A commercial association is an association whose purpose is to create, promote, distribute, or otherwise alter the economic value of goods and/or services. All activities and transactions of a commercial association should be considered economic in nature, even if the specific activity or transaction does not have an obvious economic purpose. *This definition makes no reference to profit, and should include any association operating in the commercial space.

##### Public Commercial Association

A public commercial association is a commercial association that can, through means that would be legal if the association were an ordinary commercial association, impose significant consequences on persons or associations outside of transactions with itself, including the ability to supress, hinder, or increase the cost of transactions that might substitute for transactions with itself, or that it finds undesireable for any other reason. This definition shall also include commercial associations that upon economic failure or dissolution would require significant direct intervention by an agency or agencies of government to mitigate the harms imposed on persons or associations outside of any transactions those persons or associations had with the dissolved entity. *This definition should include firms who exercise monopoly or monopsony power, firms that operate by imposing external costs on non-parties, and firms that are 'too big to fail'. It would not include firms just because the government intervenes. For example, if a small bank fails, the government protects account holders who are direct parties to transactions with the bank. This government intervention is unrelated to the kind included in this definition; this definition includes only failures that are big enough to impact those not involved in direct transactions with the bank.*

##### Ordinary Commercial Association

An ordinary commercial association is a commercial association that is not a public commercial association.
